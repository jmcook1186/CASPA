# CASPA
Cellular Automaton for SnowPack Albedo

README written and maintained by J Cook, University of Sheffield

Initial commits contain 4 versions of CASPA code previously held locally by J Cook. These four versions were produced before version control migrated to Github, so updates are marked in comments in scripts.

The code is written in Matlab and is designed to provide a framework for modelling snow albedo using radiative transfer using the BioSNICAR model (Cook et al., 2017) which adapted Mark Flanner's SNICAR code to incorporate biological impurities. Here, a cellular automaton is developed that uses BioSNICAR to calculate the albedo of a snowpack in each cell in a grid i x j, and evolves the snowpack accoridng to growth rules dervied from empirical experiments and existing literature. 

This code is in active development and is not yet published. There are no permissions granted for copying, applying or using this code.
